    Practice defining foundational class blueprints and instantiating

/** EXERCISE 1: THE ITEM INVENTORY FACTORY **/

/*
    TODO: Create a class blueprint named 'GameItem'.
    1. Give it a constructor that accepts two parameters: 'itemName' and 'goldValue'.
    2. Inside the constructor, map those parameters to 'this.name' and 'this.value'.

    1. Create a constant named 'potion' with a name of "Healing Potion" and a value of 50.
    2. Create a constant named 'shield' with a name of "Iron Shield" and a value of 150.
    Log both objects to verify their data structures.
